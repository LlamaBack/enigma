#Object Oriented Programming | 4

Cryptor Class does all the encryption and decryption so the enigma doesn't actually see how it's done

#Ruby Conventions and Mechanics | 4
No methods are 10 lines long
The map enumerable was used because it iterates over the same length message and key/shifts array

#Test Driven Development | 4
Mocks and Stubs were used in testing
Mocks and Stubs were used to get rid of the randomness of today's date
