#Object Oriented Programming | 4
One module was created to simplify the code base in Enigma Class
Cryptor Class does all the encryption and decryption so the enigma doesn't actually see how it's done

#Ruby Conventions and Mechanics | 4
No methods are 10 lines long
The map enumerable was used because it iterates over the same length message and key/shifts array

#Test Driven Development | 4
Mocks and Stubs were used in testing
Mocks and Stubs were used to get rid of the randomness of today's date
They were also used to not rely on other classes and methods within our module
Tests were also created before the methods they were testing
