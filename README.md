### Functionality | 3
Enigma Class encrypt and decrypt methods were implemented successfully. <br>
Encrypt and decrypt CLI were implemented successfully. <br>
Cracking method was not implemented successfully. <br>

### Object Oriented Programming | 4
One module was created to simplify the code base in Enigma Class. <br>
Cryptor Class does all the encryption and decryption so the enigma doesn't actually see how it's done. <br>

### Ruby Conventions and Mechanics | 4
No methods are 10 lines long. <br>
The map enumerable was used because it iterates over the same length message and key/shifts array. <br>

### Test Driven Development | 4
Mocks and Stubs were used in testing. <br>
Mocks and Stubs were used to get rid of the randomness of today's date. <br>
They were also used to not rely on other classes and methods within our module. <br>
Tests were also created before the methods they were testing. <br>

### Version Control | 4
A Minimum of 40 commits and 4 pull requests were utilized in this project. <br>
Each commit and pull request is distinct and communicates it's functionality clearly. <br>
